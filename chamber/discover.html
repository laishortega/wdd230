                <h2>Pampanga Overview</h2>
                <p> Pampanga, officially the Province of Pampanga (Kapampangan: Lalawigan ning Pampanga; Tagalog:
                    Lalawigan ng Pampanga IPA: [pɐmˈpaŋɡa] pəm-PAHNG-ga), is a province in the Central Luzon region of
                    the Philippines. Lying on the northern shore of Manila Bay, Pampanga is bordered by Tarlac to the
                    north, Nueva Ecija to the northeast, Bulacan to the east, Manila Bay to the central-south, Bataan to
                    the southwest and Zambales to the west. Its capital is the City of San Fernando. Angeles City is the
                    largest LGU, but while geographically within Pampanga, it is classified as a first-class, highly
                    urbanized city and has been governed independently of the province since it received its charter in
                    1964.</p>

                <p> The name La Pampanga was given by the Spaniards, who encountered natives living along the banks
                    (pampáng) of the Pampanga River. Its creation in 1571 makes it the first Spanish province on Luzon
                    Island (Cebu in Visayas is older as it was founded by the Spaniards in 1565). The town of Villa de
                    Bacolor in the province briefly served as the Spanish colonial capital when Great Britain invaded
                    Manila as part of the Seven Years' War. At the eve of the Philippine Revolution of 1896, Pampanga
                    was one of eight provinces placed under martial law for rebellion against the Spanish Empire; it is
                    thus represented on the Philippine national flag as one of the eight rays of the sun. </p>

                <p> Pampanga is served by Clark International Airport (formerly Diosdado Macapagal International
                    Airport), which is in Clark Freeport Zone, some 16 kilometres (9.9 mi) north of the provincial
                    capital. The province is home to two Philippine Air Force airbases: Basa Air Base in Floridablanca
                    and the former United States Clark Air Base in Angeles. Due to its growing population and
                    developments, the Clark Global City is now developed and is located in Clark Freeport Zone. In 2015,
                    the province had 2,198,110 inhabitants, while it had 1,079,532 registered voters.</p>

                <h2>History of Pampanga</h2>
                <p>Ancient Pampanga's Territorial area included portions of the modern provinces of Tarlac, Bataan,
                    Zambales, Nueva Ecija, Bulacan, Aurora, Quezon (including Polillo Islands), and Rizal, i.e. covered
                    almost the entire Central Luzon (Pampanga also included portion of Metro Manila, which is Valenzuela
                    to be exact, which was formerly known as Polo, then a town in Bulacan). When the Spanish arrived at
                    Luzon they found Pampanga to be thickly populated with several towns and that there were 3 castles
                    or forts protecting Pamapanga. Pampanga was re-organized as a province by the Spaniards on
                    December 11, 1571. For better administration and taxation purposes, the Spanish authorities
                    subdivided Pampanga into pueblos, which were further subdivided into districts (barrios) and in some
                    cases into royal and private estates (encomiendas).</p>
                <p>Due to excessive abuses committed by some encomenderos, King Philip II of Spain in 1574 prohibited
                    the further awarding of private estates, but this decree was not fully enforced until 1620. In a
                    report of Philippine encomiendas on June 20, 1591, Governor-General Gómez Pérez Dasmariñas reported
                    to the Crown that La Pampanga's encomiendas were Bataan, Betis y Lubao, Macabebe, Candaba, Apalit,
                    Calumpit, Malolos, Binto, Guiguinto, Caluya, Bulacan and Mecabayan. The encomiendas of La Pampanga
                    at that time had eighteen thousand six hundred and eighty whole tributes.</p>
                <P>Pampanga, which is about 850 square miles (2,200 km2) in area and inhabited by more than 1.5 million
                    people, had its present borders drawn in 1873. During the Spanish regime, it was one of the richest
                    Philippine provinces. Manila and its surrounding region were then primarily dependent on Kapampangan
                    agricultural, fishery and forestry products as well as on the supply of skilled workers. As other
                    Luzon provinces were created due to increases in population, some well-established Pampanga towns
                    were lost to new emerging provinces in Central Luzon.</p>
                <p>During the 17th century, The Dutch recruited men from Pampanga as mercenaries who served the Royal
                    Netherlands East Indies Army, known as Papangers[6] part of the larger Mardijkers community. Their
                    legacy can be found in North Jakarta, however, there are few traces of their descendants, except
                    for a small community in Kampung Tugu.</p>
                <p>The historic province of Bataan which was founded in 1754 under the administration of Spanish
                    Governor-General Pedro Manuel Arandia, absorbed from the province of Pampanga the municipalities of
                    Abucay, Balanga (now a city), Dinalupihan, Llana Hermosa, Orani, Orion, Pilar, and Samal.</P>
                <p>During the British occupation of Manila (1762–1764), Bacolor became the provisional Spanish colonial
                    capital and military base.</p>
                <p>The old Pampanga towns of Aliaga, Cabiao, Gapan, San Antonio and San Isidro were ceded to the
                    province of Nueva Ecija in 1848 during the term of Spanish Governor-General Narciso Claveria y
                    Zaldua. The municipality of San Miguel de Mayumo of Pampanga was yielded to the province of Bulacan
                    in the same provincial boundary configuration in 1848.</P>
                <p>In 1860, the northern towns of Bamban, Capas, Concepcion, Victoria, Tarlac, Mabalacat, Magalang,
                    Porac and Floridablanca were separated from Pampanga and were placed under the jurisdiction of a
                    military command called Comandancia Militar de Tarlac. However, in 1873, the four latter towns were
                    returned to Pampanga and the other five became municipalities of the newly created Province of
                    Tarlac.</p>
