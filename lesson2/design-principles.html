            <h2>Visual Hierarchy</h2>
            <h3>Apple</h3>
            <a href="https://www.apple.com/">apple.com</a>
            <img src="images/applemobile.png" alt="apple">
            <p>Since Virtual Hierarchy is the principle of arranging elements to show their order of importance, I think
                that the Apple Website has the most Visual Hierarchy out of all the websites I've been trying to
                look at. When you go to their page, you will see how they've executed a wonderful Visual Hierarchy! In
                my observation, I liked how you can easily see their photos and what kind of unit that photo is which
                makes it easier for viewers to know the information right in front of their faces.</p>

        <section class="repetitionsection">
            <h2>Repetition</h2>
            <h1>Netflix</h1>
            <a href="https://www.netflix.com/browse">netflix.com</a>
            <img src="images/netflixmobile.png" alt="netflix">
            <p>For the Repetition principle, I thought about the website of what we all love, Netflix. In their website,
                we can see the repetition of shapes they've used for the thumbnails of their website!</p>

        <section class="contrastsection">
            <h2>Contrast</h2>
            <h3>Spotify</h3>
            <a href="https://www.spotify.com/ph-en/download/mac/">spotify.com</a>
            <img src="images/spotifymobile.png" alt="spotify">
            <p>When talking about Contrast, I loved how Spotify executed this principle on their website! They have dark
                colors but they still managed to make their website lively with the color green! It gives off the energy
                you need when listening to music!</p>
